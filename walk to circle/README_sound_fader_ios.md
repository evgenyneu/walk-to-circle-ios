# iOS sound fader for AvAudioPlayer written in Swift

This is an iOS utility class that allows to fade sounds in and out with `AvAudioPlayer`. One can set duration and velocity of the fade. Velocity can vary from linear to logarithmic.

## Installation

Copy [iiFaderForAvAudioPlayer.swift](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evgenyneu/sound-fader-ios/master/FaderForAvAudioPlayer/iiFaderForAvAudioPlayer.swift) file to your project.

## Usage

### Play an audio file

```Swift
import AVFoundation

let soundURL = CFBundleCopyResourceURL(CFBundleGetMainBundle(), "my_lovely_horse.mp3", nil, nil)
let player = AVAudioPlayer(contentsOfURL: soundURL, error: nil)
player.play()
player.volume = 0
```

### Instantiate a fader

```Swift
let fader = iiFaderForAvAudioPlayer(player: player)
fader.fadeIn()
fader.fadeOut()
```

I would create a fader property somewhere in my app and keep a strong reference to the fader.

### Set fade duration and velocity

```Swift
fader.fadeIn(duration: 3, velocity: 2)
```

### Supply fade start/end volume, completion callback

```Swift
fader.fade(fromVolume: 0.3, toVolume: 0.7, duration: 3, velocity: 2) { finished in
// fading finished
}
```

### Set the quality of fade

```Swift
fader.volumeAlterationsPerSecond = 20
```

Larger numbers will produce finer fade effect at expense of CPU juice.

## Volume functions

The following graph shows how sound volume changes during the fade.

### Fade out formula

Where `x` is time and `v` is velocity.

Velocity of 0 creates a linear fade. Values greater than zero produce more logarithmic fade affect. Logarithmic fade sounds more gradual to a human ear. I personally use velocity values from 2 to 5.
