Dear traveller, Walk to Circle is a fun and easy game that anyone can play for walking and discovery. It is designed to get you exploring new places in your neighbourhood, helps improve your memory skills and have fun – all at the same time!

The game starts by placing a circle at random on a map within about 400 metres (1,300 feet) of your starting location. Pay attention, because you have just 5 seconds in which to memorise the circle’s location before it disappears!

Your task is to then walk to the circle, guided only by your memory of its whereabouts. A notification on your device will let you know once you have successfully reached the circle. Each walk to circle takes about 5-10 minutes to complete. How many new places will you discover today?

I love walking and exploring my city and Walk to Circle has led me to many places just a stone’s throw from my house that I had never been to before. For those that like to walk, or who maybe want a reason to get out and walk more, this app is great for taking you away from the same old familiar routes and helping you to discover new places in your town or city.

If you have an Apple Watch the app will show your walking direction as you travel, bringing an added dimension to the game.

Note: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease the battery life of your device. Walk to Circle will help preserve your battery life by automatically stopping GPS monitoring after one hour.

I wish you happy and safe walking. I’d love to hear how you get on and welcome all feedback on the app. Drop me a message at evgenii.com.
