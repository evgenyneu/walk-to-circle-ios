Dear traveler, this game is made for walking. It will help you explore your neighbourhood, improve memory skills and lift spirits.

The game places a circle on the map at random location. You have 5 seconds to memorise it before the map is closed. Then you walk to the circle and receive a notification upon reaching it.

The circle is placed at about 400 meters (1,300 feet) from your current location. Each walk takes about 5-10 minutes to complete.

If you have an Apple Watch it will show your the walking direction.

I love walking and exploring my city. While using the app I found many hidden places just near my house where Iâ€™ve never been. The game picks walking destination randomly which can break habit of choosing the same paths and helps discover new ways.

Drop me a message at evgenii.com. I wish you happy and safe walking.

Note: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. The app will save your battery life by stoping GPS monitoring automatically in the app after one hour.
