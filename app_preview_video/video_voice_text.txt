Script for Walk to Circle iOS app
—————————————————


<the map is shown in the video>

This app is made for walking. 
It gives you a nearby area that you’ll walk to

You’ll have five seconds to remember its location.

And then…bye bye map!

Do you think you can remember where the circle was?.

When you reach your goal, the app will tell you!.
